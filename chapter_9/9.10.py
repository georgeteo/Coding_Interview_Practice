CCC 9.10: You have a stack of n boxes with width w_i, height h_i, and depth h_i,
and depth d_i. The boxes cannot be rotated, only stacked if each box is strictly
larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth.
Implement a method to build the tallest stack possible, where the height of a stack
of the stack is the sum of the heights of the boxes.
