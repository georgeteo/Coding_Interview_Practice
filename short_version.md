3.  Bubble Sort
4.  Insert Sort
5.  Merge Sort
6.  Heap Sort
7.  Quick Sort/Quick select
    -   Nuts and bolts problem

8.  Radix Sort
    - Given array of integers, take each integer mod 10 divide 1. Put into linked list.
    - Then consider linked lists in order.
    - Then repeat for mod 100 divide 10.
    - Repeat his process util divide by biggest power of 10 in array.
    - Sort n numbers from range 0 to 2\^n-1 in linear time

9.  Counting Sort
10. Bucket Sort
11. Shell Sort

### Greedy Algorithms

1.  Activity Selection: You are given n activities with their start and
    finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be
    performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work
    on a single activity at a time.
2.  Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm:
    1.  Sort all edges in increasing order of weight
    2.  Pick smallest edge, check if it forms a cycle using the
        Union-Find algorithm. If not, add edge.
    3.  Repeat until there are v-1 edges

3.  Huffman Coding: TODO
4.  Prims Algorithm for MST
5.  Dijkstra's Shortest Path
6.  Job Sequencing Problem: Given an array of jobs where every job has a
    deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the
    deadline
    -   Sort jobs by decreasing profit and pick jobs that can fit

### Dynamic Programming

1.  Longest Increasing Subsequence
    -   O(n\^2) time complexity
    -   Store longest increasing subsequence so far

2.  Edit distance
    -   TODO

3.  Longest increasing subsequence
    -   L(A, B) = Max(L(A\[:n-1\], B\[n-1\])) + 1 if A\[n\] == B\[n\]
    -   Max(L(A\[:n-1\], B\[:n\]), L(A\[:n\], B\[:n-1\]))

### Pattern Search

1.  Naive: consider each point as the starting point
2.  KMP Algorithm:
    -   Build longestPrefixSuffix Array by setting i = 0, j = 1. If i ==
        j, store i+1 in LPS and increment i and j. If i != j, increment
        j, store 0 at position j in LPS Array or make i = LPS\[i-1\],
        and check again.
    -   Iterate through array (j) and pattern array (i). If mismatch,
        then LPS\[i-1\] is the next point of comparison in
        pattern array.

### Divide and Conquer

1.  Find median of two sorted arrays.
    -   Take median of both arrays: med1, med2.
    -   If med1 &lt; med2, look for median in right half of arr1 and
        left half of arr2.
    -   Repeat til only 4 elements left.

2.  Counting Inversions: merge sort with counter
3.  Closest pair of points
    -   Sort by x coordinate.
    -   Split plane into two halves
    -   Find min = min(min\_left, min\_right)
    -   Consider all points distance min from split point
    -   min = min(min, min\_split)
